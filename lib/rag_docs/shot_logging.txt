Shot-Level Logging & Data Capture Philosophy
Purpose

Shot-level data is the backbone of meaningful golf analysis — but only if it’s fast, intuitive, and realistic to log during play.

This product is designed around a simple belief:

The best data is the data golfers are actually willing to record.

What Gets Logged

Instead of overwhelming users with dozens of inputs per shot, the app focuses on high-signal information:

Drives

direction (left / center / right)

lie (fairway, rough, hazard, recovery)

Approaches

approximate distance

result (GIR, short, long, left, right)

Short Game

chip or pitch outcome

distance context when relevant

Putting

number of putts

miss direction when applicable

These inputs are intentionally outcome-focused, not swing-focused.

Why Outcome-Based Data Matters

Golf is a results game.

Instead of trying to analyze swing mechanics, the app tracks what actually happened — and uses that to surface patterns like:

missed approaches from specific distances

directional tendencies under pressure

short game consistency inside scoring range

putting efficiency by distance band

This allows for actionable insights without requiring a launch monitor or sensors.

Designed for In-Round Use

Key principles guiding the logging experience:

one screen per hole

minimal taps

no typing unless optional notes are added

quick editing if a hole is revisited

The golfer can log a hole in seconds, not minutes.

Prefilled & Editable Inputs

When revisiting a hole:

previously logged values are automatically prefilled

golfers can edit shots without friction

completed holes are visually marked

This ensures data stays accurate without being annoying.

Optional Notes & Context

Golfers can optionally add short notes such as:

mental mistakes

wind conditions

club selection regrets

execution thoughts

These notes are treated as qualitative context, not required fields.

They become especially powerful when combined with AI analysis later.

Data Consistency Over Perfection

The app prioritizes consistency over absolute precision.

It’s better to log:

“missed right from 165”
than:

nothing at all because the input was too complex

This approach leads to stronger long-term trends and better AI insights.

How the Data Feeds the AI

Every logged shot becomes part of the golfer’s evolving profile:

distance tendencies

miss patterns

scoring efficiency by hole type

decision outcomes over time

The AI uses this data to adapt advice, not just report stats.

Philosophy

This isn’t about turning golf into a data science experiment.

It’s about capturing just enough truth to play smarter next time.
