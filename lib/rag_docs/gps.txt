On-Course GPS & Map Intelligence
Purpose

The on-course map is the foundation of the in-round experience.
It provides real-time spatial awareness so golfers can make confident, informed decisions before every shot.

This is not just a yardage screen — it’s a decision surface.

Core Map Experience

The app uses an interactive, satellite-style golf map that shows the hole in context, including:

the golfer’s current position

the pin location

optional targets and landing areas

Distances update dynamically as markers are moved, giving golfers a clear picture of what each shot actually requires.

The map is intentionally minimal and uncluttered so it can be used mid-round without slowing play.

Draggable Markers & Live Yardages

The map supports multiple draggable markers, each serving a specific purpose:

Player marker — current ball location

Target marker — preferred landing area or layup point

Pin marker — hole location

As markers move, the app recalculates:

distance from ball to target

distance from target to pin

total carry vs remaining yardage

This allows golfers to visualize risk vs reward in real time.

Why This Matters

Most golfers don’t struggle because they lack swing mechanics — they struggle because they:

misjudge distances

choose the wrong target

underestimate trouble

overestimate carry

The map helps eliminate guesswork by making the hole measurable and understandable, not just visible.

Designed for Real Play

Key design principles:

Fast load times

Smooth drag interactions

No unnecessary overlays

Readable outdoors in bright light

The map is meant to be used standing over the ball, not studied like a spreadsheet.

Integration with the AI Caddie

The map is not isolated — it feeds directly into the AI system.

When a golfer asks for advice or receives a suggestion, the AI already knows:

current yardage

relative pin position

selected target

distance gaps between shots

This allows the AI to reason spatially, not just statistically.

Strategic Use Cases

The map enables golfers to:

choose safer layup zones

plan approach distances they prefer

avoid short-siding misses

decide when going for it makes sense

It shifts the golfer’s mindset from “How far is it?” to “What’s the smartest play?”

Philosophy

A good caddie doesn’t just tell yardage — they help you see the hole correctly.

The map exists to do exactly that.
