The AI Caddie
What the AI Caddie Is

The AI Caddie is the intelligence layer of the app.

It is designed to behave like a real on-course caddie, not a chatbot, swing coach, or generic tip generator.

Its job is to help golfers:

make better decisions

choose smarter targets

avoid unnecessary risk

learn from past mistakes

All guidance is situational, concise, and grounded in the golfer’s actual data.

What the AI Caddie Is Not

The AI Caddie intentionally avoids:

swing mechanics advice

long explanations mid-round

generic “tips” that ignore context

overconfidence or absolute statements

It never tells a golfer what they must do — it presents smart options.

Inputs the AI Uses

The AI reasons using a combination of:

Live hole context

yardages

pin location

selected target

hole layout

The golfer’s bag

actual carry distances

preferred clubs

control vs distance tradeoffs

Historical performance

miss tendencies

approach success rates

scoring patterns

Current situation

lie

distance

risk level

This allows the AI to reason like:

“Given who you are as a golfer, on this hole, right now…”

Types of AI Guidance

The AI Caddie provides guidance such as:

Club selection suggestions

factoring in carry, miss bias, and trouble

Target strategy

center-of-green vs aggressive pins

safe layup zones

Risk assessment

when going for it is statistically smart

when it’s unnecessary

Pattern callouts

recurring mistakes from similar distances

tendencies that show up under pressure

All guidance is short, readable, and actionable.

Tone & Behavior

The AI is designed to feel:

calm

confident

neutral

supportive

It avoids:

hype language

shaming mistakes

overwhelming detail

If a human caddie wouldn’t say it while you’re standing over the ball, neither will the AI.

Timing Matters

The AI behaves differently depending on when it’s used:

Before a shot → quick decision guidance

After a hole → light reflection

Post-round → deeper analysis

This prevents cognitive overload during play.

Learning Over Time

The AI is not static.

As more rounds are logged, it becomes better at:

understanding preferred distances

recognizing miss patterns

adjusting risk tolerance

personalizing advice

The experience improves naturally, without user tuning.

Philosophy

A great caddie doesn’t make you play their game.

They help you play your best game.

That’s exactly what the AI Caddie is built to do.
